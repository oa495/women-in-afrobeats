'Round here main way to provide for your kin Is in a flick blade, little push-bike and a sim In London a place where it's nicer to live Is only five minutes out from the guys on the strip Where man make yay' work, heard he a soldier I know that nigga hasn't got balls like Grey Worm As I grow older, change of perspective I gotta stay loyal to my girl, that's the trait she was blessed with Restaurants, raves with my bredrins Life's too short, so we gotta turn up Man talk on my ting for the 'Gram, it's intrusive I never really thought 'bout taking a life 'Til I found out my ex-girl's dad is abusive I felt \"How could I be a man and not do shit?\" I'm on the way there now, and I don't wanna lose it But fightin' her battle's only hurtin' the girl How can I protect her from the world When I couldn't even protect her from myself? On my grandmother's grave, shit happens again I put a knife through a family friend Most the women that I know had shit happen to them So innocent 'til guilty, ain't somethin' that I have to respect I think back to my youth and I was so ungrateful How many of our parents had dreams they abandoned So they could put food on the table? Intelligent, worthy and able, that's somebody's parent You know? And that affected the way that I see shit Night club toilet, you peed on the seat 'Cause you don't know how it feels when your mum's gotta clean shit And her boss treats her like she don't even mean shit And she gotta wait for the bus in the rain and it's freezin' And Miss said that you would never be shit And you don't wanna cry about dad, but you need him I grew up so fucked, but I didn't even deep it I'm numb to the feelin' of grievin' And man gettin' birded African mums on the floor, just screamin' It's mad 'cah I try so hard Death's got to be easy, cah life's so hard I was twelve wishin' that I was a white man, hard 'Cah if I was then they probably wouldn't life mans dargs I was dead broke, fam, I couldn't swipe mans card And time might pass, but I still gotta stay with it It wasn't his beef, but I see him try claimin' it That's why he caught a bullet with another man's name on it Now he can't do leg day or put strain on it Every time you hear me freestyle, I put pain in it I used to wonder \"Does God have favorites?\" Touch me, it's dangerous, I wouldn't play with it 'Cause you can go sleep, and have a different type of wake for it I miss my dawgs, unstable You violate Chris? Then rah, turn Chris Benoit Have him hit from far, nah Fill 'em up with bricks and glass , nah My young G's will grip, then blast Have you tried in the street Fuck findin' my feet I could ride, but it's better when I'm ridin' a beat My emotions are peak, it ain't a sign of defeat or the weak I would've **** you, then cried in my sleep Dropped Juss two racks and told him \"Buy the machine\" I'm LeBron in Miami, I provide for the heat God strike me if I'm lyin', I ain't cryin' in this beef Unless the tears comin' tatted on the side of my cheek I provide for my peeps,  the Lamb' white in the seats So I'm literally a wolf disguised in a sheep You have five figure dreams, I have five figure sleep Five hours more than enough time that I need Man want a fair fight, but I ain't on it when we see him Fuck honour, this revolver is onomatopoeic Let it \"Stut-tut-tut-tut-tut-tut-ter\" when you see him Free Scalez, Free C and free my niggas 'til I see 'em I wouldn't wanna be him My OG's roamin', I don't need a colosseum You see it? So I'm playin' it good, let hood politics stay in the hood Fuck the Internet, you see this new generation They're Insta-beefing and I ain't into speakin' When I ducked down I had him runnin' in a lift like he missed a meetin' There's no good reason to risk your freedom The yutes dem snitch and them bitches sneakin' She don't wanna talk 'bout friendships She just wanna deal with the pipe like I'm fixin' leakin' And sleep with a legend like Chrissy Teigen Where I'm from the word \"Life\" has a different meanin' Man smile in your face, but them niggas schemin' Try involve me in a flakey dealin' Sistine Chapel, I'ma paint the ceilin' I been violated and I hate the feelin' That's why nowadays man hates the preachin' We smile in the visit, cah we ain't defeated The Supreme Court's where my mates appealin' I can't breed that girl, that's torture South London, it's just slags on the corner And influencers tryna bag them a baller She a gold-digger, I can tell from her aura Her socials say princess, she a pauper When it's time for it, need more for my daughter Call me a talker, but man are gettin' lined like lambs in the slaughter It's life-threatening and I can tell from the borer Cut through a nigga like a knife through flora Feds got the guys on a case and they  stalk us It's a conspiracy like tinfoil hats and a new world order Touch me, you better have a life insurer Blood thirsty, I got sharks in the water And trust me, I know a killer well, no orca Have you ever seen a nightmare brought to life? Where I'm from, you get cheffed on a normal night Men talk on my name, but it's porkie pies I'll really put it in a prick like a porcupine Little bro wanna save for a .45 Go board a flight, there's more to life Yutes on the M6 all the time We don't need TFL for a northern line All the best politicians been taught to lie Where do they buy cocaine when they're snorting white? Are their dealers safe or on the borderline? It's ironic, cah we don't know where to draw the line Man see  Blue Story , they're mortified Man see  Scarface  and it's glorified 'Cause when you're black, everything gets scrutinized That's why they call it \"Urban\", it gets euphemized South London, man are gettin' euthanized I see a yute's demise, I wasn't too surprised He got soaked but his right hand scuba dived Don't die by a sword that you used to shine You can drown for your king, you don't know about Ophelia Cah we got iron, I don't know about anaemia I took the hard road, we don't know 'bout the easier One bag of whores and drug paraphernalia When ends got sticky, had a flicky with Emelia, I mean Olivia This ain't Libya, this ain't Syria You act sillier, we let it seep in your skin like Nivea Who wants to be a millionaire? I won it Never done a gameshow or trivia I done Wandsworth, Erlestoke visitor I done Springhill, Grendon, Swinfen, Whitemoor, Swaleside, Brixton visitor I done M-way trips, done shit that I wish I never did Becah I could have been a prisoner Is this the shit that appeals to the listeners? Road ain't no amazing life The ends full of snakes and jails, just a waste of time I tell my young G's \"Take your time\" Fuck Jazz, you can really see a major nine Yo, I'm so ashamed of how I used to get figures Man sell you a dream like the road ting's lit And then they leave out the parts where you're burying your niggas Or in jail, wonderin' who's puttin' dick inside your Mrs I'm so fuckin' determined I was in intensive care when I was born, mummy fell down the stairs Whether I was gonna live or not was somethin' uncertain I used the word \"Fell\", with the commas inverted You see, growin' up I had it far from perfect But nobody did, so I'm a normal person I gotta be grateful, we all have demons and all see angels Or maybe it's me A black yute's more than a face on a screen A number on a laptop or name on a sheet We got stories to tell and got places to be From my heart, that's the makin' of me  I was selling, look, I was selling tomatoes I sell, my legs hurts I struggled 'cause I didn't want to suffer again I just wanted, it just make me so upset Three times I tried I went to Hannover, they sent me back I tried so much, he has not seen anything yet I was in detention camps for months at the end, I didn't give up I was not even twenty when I left Africa I was determined to survive I was determined to succeed I didn't know anybody, nobody was ready to help me Even when you were born You were six weeks old, this one is not even Africa, it's this nation I was on the streets for three years I have three babies in my hand Nobody let me in, nobody in this nation I couldn't pay my rent, deported gangsters carried- I didn't give up, I carried my babies everywhere And now this is how you pay me back for all those pain that I go through Everyday I lay in my bed, I'm in pain You see what he's doing to me, you want to kill me, you want to kill me 15 Embed    "

It's like flyin' first class on a crashin' plane Dinners with the same niggas, just higher bills And all the models Himalayan, they got higher heels  You know we're all alone in this together, right?  You know the seats in the Aston r\u0435d leather, like   Yeah  I had dreams of doin' architecture Or sittin' through a Harvard lecture How the fuck I end up bein' Harvey Specter? Young black art collector, I could take the pressure Had scales, now suits that come made to measure I drew the thin line between love and hate Double date, what you drinkin'? Let me cut the games Backstabbin' man, I'd rather that you cut my face If I ain't charmin' the women, it's all the fuckin' snakes You idolize the girl, there's no way I wife her She only fucks with rich niggas, that's the way I like it I can't fabricate the truth, it's just the way I write it You got points on your creative license Ask Rapz, that's a criminal graduatin' in civil law Nothin' ain't civil 'bout the Civil War Grip a four, Gryffindor, this'll have you lyin' on your chest I got ninety-nine marks, I wasn't tryin' on my test I'm blessed  Because the pasta is gamberoni, the watch is a classic Rollie The pussy is sacred, it's holy like matrimony I'm payin' the alimony to numb all the acrimony The flight is to Santorini, the car is a Lamborghini The cheese, the cheddar, the mozzarella, the fettucine The only aim, look at my ego in a day in the life You see what happens when you got the fuckin' game in a vice We're all alone  I got a message from a kid on Sunday mornin' Said he don't know what to do and that he's thinkin' of killin' himself Me and him got more in common than he thinks But I tell him to see a shrink so I can go on and live with myself I knew that my life was a film From when I had to share a bed with my mum and I was pissin' myself I just want my flowers while I'm here So I can put them at the front of the grave that I've been diggin' myself I grew up in a two-bed flat with seven people livin' with me You don't know what I did for myself My mum's the one that gave me opportunities And put me in positions that I couldn't have pictured myself We're from Nigeria, Benin City, Sin City Don't know what it's like? Take a trip for yourself Poverty is killin' us, the government's killin' us If they ain't killin' us, then we're killin' ourselves I would die for the niggas I love My life's full of plot-holes, and I'm fillin' 'em up I told mummy, \"I ain't nothin' like my father\" I'ma show her there's a different definition to love I tell my fans we're all alone in this together You can trust me, all the shit that you been feelin', you're feelin' with me We all took the wrong turns in different streets We all cry the same tears on different cheeks I got a message from a kid on Monday mornin' Said he's grateful I responded and he's feelin' at peace with himself Me and him got more in common than he thinks But I tell him it's nothin' big so I can go on and live with myself I knew that God would cast me as the leader Somethin' special when he messaged me and told me that I saved his life In twenty-three years, I done so much wrong But in that moment, I just felt like I had made it right  Hey Dave, it's Molly Cowan Um, we sent to you a, um, movie An NDA to sign, um, in an e-mail and also by DocuSign For, um, a movie called ****, um, which **** is directing with **** And Nina Gold is casting Ehm, there's very little info that we have But, um, I think we definitely want to put our hat in the ring for and go for If there is a way in which you could do a tape out there Please have a look and get back right away, thanks, bye 13 Embed    "

When you feel like givin' up, know you're close I been sayin' the least and knowin' the most I've had ups and downs, but the highest of the highs Never last for as long as the lowest of lows Survivor's guilt I feel the worst at my happiest 'Cause I miss all my niggas that couldn't be in this life I built But that's the type of shit that only I can feel Gettin' me in the mood My ex has got ivory skin Which is funny 'cause it's really the elephant in the room Is that enough reason to bury me in a tomb? I fell in love with an Albanian, I know it's mad We're not together, 'cause her family would hold us back I saw the red flags, I wouldn't want my child to grow in that Rum and Red Bull, it's a culture clash  I don't wanna let life tear us apart I see the Internet gossip and it wears on my heart I fuck with her, she was there from the start I'm seein' them laugh at me, cah I'm vulnerable Ain't that the shit that rappers' supposed to do? I'd rather rap about arguin' with my girl than fuckin' your girl But I don't mind, because the both are true Ignorin' my messages, these times I know she on her\u2014 Worst part is I wouldn't even do the same Hate it or love it, you gotta charge it to the game  Heavy is the head, but don't play with my heart I feel like a footballer when I'm makin' my art Through ball, how I'm managin' the weight of the past I felt so much pain that I got favorite scars And my house got wings like my favorite cars And the milly rock my favorite dance You can call it what you want it, but I got it off of takin' a chance I didn't take an advance Fame comes with a price, you can't pay in advance For six long years, I've been playin' my part Like a freak in a circus when they're makin' them dance I got nights where it's light and I got days where it's dark And the waters that I swim in, it ain't safe for the sharks He a gangster, but the stress gonna take him apart I'm with the niggas that I claimed from the start I see you niggas changin', they didn't make it It's a shame it takes fallin' to your death For a person to appreciate fully the gravity of the situation But that's just irony at its finest Black women, I just wanna say I'm sorry I done a lot of dumb shit, I won't lie to you I wanna be a voice for you, be a light for you I know I haven't done enough, I wanna try for you Wanna be on the frontline for you Campaign for you, make change for you I just wanna help in any way Bein' genuine, I think about it every day Tour life, travellin' every day Nerves paralysing when you get to stage You feel love for an hour, and then it gets to fade Imagine what that does to your mental state Imagine bein' a millionaire at a tender age You don't even know whether to spend or save My mum had to grow up fast, she expects the same I was twenty with a mortgage and rent to pay So what's happenin'? I got guerillas all around me, allow me Don't get grabbed in a party or lack in it You'll die for a whine like Joffrey Baratheon Pattern 'em The government ain't gonna help with all the issues that I'm tacklin' The way you talk about politics is bafflin' I wouldn't even trust my own shadow in a cabinet Cabbin\u2019 it, can't drive no more I been lookin' for the answers, sure that I'll find 'em I don't judge an accent but the story behind it We all know loss, but there's glory behind it I'ma make a film for my mum And tell her, \"Tell to the world this album is just the soundtrack\" Look at her story in a year in her life And tell me if it doesn't bring a fuckin' tear to your eyes In this together  I thought wishin' wouldn't hurt, but take it over I\u2019m done holdin\u2019 at your lies So knowin' that it weren\u2019t for any one thing You know you love fast and I know you want to stay In the clouds, my head\u2019s sippin' up Let the other try, said I don\u2019t wanna try I thought wishin' wouldn't hurt, but take it over I\u2019m done holdin\u2019 at your lies So knowin' that it weren\u2019t for any one thing You know you love fast and I know you want to stay In the clouds, my head\u2019s sippin' up Let the other try, I don\u2019t wanna try  What I've realised What I realised 'bout who I am Is that, you're kinda taught You're taught to die for what you stand for, you feel me? But I realise I'm here to live for what I stand for 'Cause I wanna see it, bro, I wanna enjoy it, bro I wanna see what I feel, like I am, you know what I'm sayin'? Out there, while I'm here, and that's that, bro But yeah, link up soon my guy, you know how it is Hustle o\u2019clock, bruv, shine on 'em 5 Embed    "

Big Notting Hill carni, you can't see? And the ride's fiber glass, G, you wan' see? Imagine a place where you rais\u0435 your kids The only place you live says you ain't a Brit Th\u0435y're deportin' our people and it makes me sick 'Cause they were broken by the country that they came to fix It's like  They came at the invitation of the British Government Their passports were stamped 'indefinite leave to remain' But for some, who were children then, that was a false promise Thirty-seven years of paying taxes and I got a letter saying I was an illegal immigrant I came here to England at the age of ten and I've lived here all my life  Look, imagine a world that's flawed and full of evil Where dictators and leaders are persecutin' your people The bodies of the innocents are pilin' to the steeples The ironic part is they're preyin' on the feeble That's life in the 90s, you're Eastern European And you're seein' people dyin' 'cause they're fightin' for their freedom They show you violence for havin' a voice You move out with your kids in hope of havin' a choice Life throws you a spanner, you can't handle the pain So you gamble and you drink and then you gamble again You argue with your wife and then you sleep on the couch You hit your children and start freezin' 'em out You try and work things out, but it's never the same All the women in your household are livin' afraid When you look into the mirror you're reminded again That you've become the dictator you were fightin' against It's like  We're fightin' for our rights, for our motherland And then we - we - we are fighting for our homes We are fighting for our, our fa-  Look, imagine a world that's fucked and untrue Where the many pay a price for the few And every day the sun rises a little later That's how it is when your oppressor is your liberator That's right now livin' in the Middle East Pray Salah for the peace Death from a sky littered with stars You run away with your kids so you can give them a chance But your asylum has got you in a different war Because the British wanna know what you're livin' here for We rely on migration more than ever before They're key workers, but they couldn't even get in the door When you're at Heaven's gates, what you tellin' the Lord? You wouldn't even let a kid into some steadier shores That's a life they may never afford Surely you would wanna give your people chances that were better than yours? No?  In ten years of conflict, and twelve-thousand children have been killed or injured The children here are just a tiny fraction of the estimated six-million that are in need of emergency humanitarian assistance It's thought perhaps as many as three-million no longer live in their own homes And up to two-million children no longer attend school The opportunities of this generation have been changed forever by this conflict  I went to silence when I needed to know who the, who the fuck I was, bro And like, I won't hear anyone else, shut everyone else out So I could just hear myself, bro You know what I'm sayin'? 'Cause we live in this world, yeah You stand still, the way the tide\u2019s set up It will take you away from yourself, you feel me? So then I was like \"Aight, cool\" But, I had to get silent, but it's not like man's goin' against the tide 'Cause goin' against the tide still makes it about them Still makes it about the poison that you've internalised in your mind, you feel me? It's like \"Bro, why am I in this water?\" Man, this water don't even like me, it's not even for me It's not takin' me where I wanna go, it's not takin' me where I wanna go It's who the fuck I am, bro, you know what I'm sayin'? So the tide will tell me  that bein' black is an obstacle See what I'm sayin'? I had to, switch Rivers, bro I say bein' black is an asset I am who I am because I'm black And I love everything about it, you feel me? And that's who the fuck I am 8 Embed    "

To you I'm smiling, but really, I'm hurting I dedicate my life and gave my heart over twenty-something years Left wondering how I even feel But was it even worth it? I bottle up and then spill it in verses One day, I'm wordless, next day, I'm a wordsmith Close to success, but to happiness, I'm the furthest At night, I wonder if my tears will dry on their own Hoping I will fulfil Amy's purpose Angel said, \"Don't let you ego be a disturbance\" Inner demon said, \"Motherfucker, you earned this\" Like they strip you of everything you're deserving Realise there is a prison in us, we are conditioned as fuck Man, it's like they can't sleep till our spirit is crushed How much fighting must we do? We've been fearless enough All we seen is broken homes here and poverty Corrupt government officials, lies, and atrocities How they talking on what's threatening the economy? Knocking down communities to re-up on properties I'm directly affected, it does more than just bother me Look beyond the surface, don't just see what you wanna see My speech ain't involuntary Projecting intentions straight from my lungs I'm a Black woman and I'm a proud one We walk in blind faith not knowing the outcome But as long as we're unified, then we've already won  Find a way, I'll find a way The world's not over I will make it, don't you cry In God we trust 'Cause we're not alone  Sometimes I can be introvert Feels like, feels like, feels like I can be introvert Introvert Feels like, feels like, feels like I can be introvert Sometimes I can be introvert  And so it begins The base is an amalgamation of everything Rules are not to be played by rebels The story of never-ending Your introversion led you here Intuition protected you along the way Feelings allowed you to be well balanced And perspective gave you foresight The top of the mountain is nothing without the climb Only the strong will survive Only the strong  Alone, but not lonely Your truth unveils with time As you embark on a journey Of what it takes to be a woman 32 Embed    "

For instance there is no law that allows you to take money from the church, invest in business, and privatize it. No. It is only in Nigeria were you can take money from the church, money contributed by poor congregation members. You go and set up a university that the members cannot attend. Cannot send their children to. It's against the rule and the law of God. It's against the constitution 3 Embed    "

Smells like jealousy in the air Dunno who they're tryna scare Looked at the man in the mirror, that's the only enemy that I fear A zombie knows who to frighten Just know I love the action, but I move in silence And, right now I'm just takin' what's mine Till Elizabeth returns the diamond  Wah gwan, brudda?

Time to hustle for the money, give a change to your mother Change them sheets, you got stains on the cover Better look sharp, now your face on the cover Hm, who's that pressing on the buzzer?

Did it all with my art and it came from the heart Now they take me to court But it's cool because my Richard Mille is now worth half a mil And the price goin' up so I don't need no love  Remember when they said they don't believe in me no more I was sleeping on the ground, on the cold floor Whole time I was grinding, I been tryin' to achieve Working night and day, you know my people no dey sleep I got every Louis V collection from Virgil Now my life a fashion show, no rehearsal Dior from Kim Jones, Bottega from Daniel 100K my ring so I'm not shaking no hands, no, oh 2 Embed    "

    "lyrics": "Another Story Lyrics  To understand Nigeria, you need to appreciate where it came from In  1900 , Britain officially assumed responsibility for the administration of the whole of what we now know as Nigeria from the Niger Company And then, gradually over the years, British protectorates were established throughout the territory In 1914, the protectorates were amalgamated into one Nigeria Actually, there's one additional detail that bears mentioning. In order to take over the territories from the Niger Company, the British Government paid 865,000 pounds. A huge amount in 1900. So let's establish a simple truth, the British didn't travel halfway across the world just to spread democracy Nigeria started off as a business deal for them, between a company and a government. Incidentally, the Niger Company is still around today. Only it is known by a different name,   Unilever But that's another story   Ay!

If it smell like syrup you gon' get this work But if it smell like perch, gotta disperse I'm a pervert wearin' sherbet, take your baby mama, turn her As a youngin' mama should have handcuffed me to the furnace  This can't be real, I'm in a dream I don't have skin, I just shine They can't contain me I'm free It feels like losing your mind 1 Embed    "

Come to Esau in a year, he'll have freedom He ask why I hadn't been to see him Really, I ain't have a good reason He said, \"Rah, give back what you receivin\" In a race against time, I was caught In the same game as you, but long live the sport It's time travelin It's the C-double-O and I'm back again Take this back and then, tell a friend Spaces and places you been Time travelin *fades out* time travelin....

    "lyrics": "Shadow Of Doubt Lyrics  What it feels like to have your entire Belief system overloaded with skepticism To never know the day that you'll finallly be able To live beyond the shadow of the doubt After living in darkness for so long Seems like I have all the right questions But never enough answers And my faith is small enough To fill in the cracks of our palms... God Every night I lay down my head down to sleep The city of my mind is attacked By the legions of questions Threatening the living rooms of my sanity In order to be.... help me help me help me  Bright lights guy, put it on Stardom's close, I feel the storms But how I can I elevate myself When my immediate environment Is looking quite deformed My egbon told me Wale there\u2019s a guy code Blam babes, make dough and just lie low If not, lagos will turn you to a psycho While I feel, he just told me live fast to die slow And I smoke, then I float Then I walk on tightropes It\u2019s naija, sometime hopeless Sometimes we might grow Fat lady\u2019s singing but won\u2019t hit them highnotes I\u2019m like  \"bro, It\u2019s like we just stuck in a cycle\" My guy dey vex he had triplets Hasn\u2019t even finished setting up his business Meanwhile, they giving yansh out for Christmas Men these babes are not playing men Check the statistics It\u2019s cold out here in these streets  You can't shoot me when you know that I'm out You can't move me if you know that I'm not there now You're hiding in a cloud bed of lies And you're stuck behind; a shadow of doubt  What's our purpose on this earth? Are we free or are we slaves? Destiny and destination Are they different or the same? If God knows every move Before I even choose a lane Then do I have free will? Does my future alternate? How come humans only be using 10% of their brains? How can I be 'out' my mind And still be 'in'-sane? Why don't all African countries unite? make peace? Why we call that shit freedom Knowing that it's not free? Who's sending subliminal messages on my TV? Are theses economic systems just a form of slavery? With all of this information... How does one pick out the truth? Why's the whole world obsessed With power and making loot? Okay we export oil.... How bout our refineries? Are we married to corruption Or is it like a disease? If the answer is the latter Then does someone know the cure? Should we use the word holy In conjunction with a war? Whats Good? Whats Bad? Whats Evil? Whats pure? How do i free my mind? My emotions? and my thoughts? How come sometimes I get the feeling That I've been here before? These are just a few questions That be troubling ya boy.... you know  The election is over Declare me winner It's time to rule Ibrahim is the president He won all the local governments And they are taking us to court  You can't shoot me when you know that I'm out You can't move me if you know that I'm not there now You're hiding in a cloud bed of lies And you're stuck behind; a shadow of doubt Embed    "

They told me not to diss you 'cause nobody know you in your city Last time you trended, you was in Abuja flashing titties You a bitch-made nigga, emotional, learn a lesson You the '05 Usher when he was dropping \"Confessions\"  I spotted you in Lagos, you were seen bragging In an Uber cab and I was cruising in a G-wagon And I couldn't help but pity you, I'd leave it in the past But it's unfortunate your own people treating you like trash  This how I murder handicapped clones Ain't no shame being a tranny, Blaqbonez  I don't give a fuck, I'ma body Blaqbonez Don't ever think you can fuck with Khaligraph Jones You ain't no lyricist, nigga, your shit is a joke You wanted fire, now you tryna get rid of the smoke Best rapper in Africa, I'm considered the GOAT Next time, pay your lazy fans to get them to vote Was in your hood doing a research and getting mad answers They never heard of Blaqbonez, the've only heard of Black Panther  Bam, now tell me how you think you in my level, clown If I was you, I would retire and settle down  Why you looking stressed, my amigo? The purpose for this diss is to help you boost your ego Saw your interview, and how you claim to be the next Davido Then I came and I beat you right in front of your people Now you wearing wedding dresses, damn, what a shame Nigerian rappers used to be the hardest in the game But along the way, it changed and then you started chasing fame Fix your lives up before you think of mentioning my name  Mode 9 and M.I, those will be the best  Vector tha Viper, he got my respect  Ice Prince Zamani, he's the coldest in the west The rest are doing Afrobeats, motherfucker, what a mess It's not that I'm hating, but it's a fact We see all the new dance moves, but who's doing the rap? At least Ycee is rapping and putting y'all in the map And 90 percent of you new rapping niggas sound wack Now back to Blaqbonez, nigga, you a done chapter  I'm taking the top 5 and the rest come after  I'ma pour gasoline so I can make you burn faster You a comedian, Idikoko, slush-turned-rapper \"Somebody tell Khaligraph that I was just joking And his Nigerian brother, I didn't mean to provoke him\" So now you wanna reach out, tryna ring my celly? This is beef, Slim Shady versus Machine Gun Kelly I was in SoundCity making out with some of your hoes You was in SoundCity making out with some of your bros And I almost approached you, but for real, I was confused 'Cause y'all look like Bow-Wow in 2002 A bunch of skinny little dudes tryna mess with a G  Even John Cena couldn't wrestle with me  OG, motherfucker, repping the East I got conditions just in case you tryna settle this beef I wanna be a citizen in Nigeria, fuck a visa A mansion in the island and about 10 divas A Bentley and a Porsche since I'm coming for the crown 'Cause I'm the best Kenyan-Nigerian rapper in town So die, nigga, 'cause your casket closed  You fraud-ass nigga, man, you cats exposed  Heh, you can never match this flow And the next time I see you, I'ma smack you hoe  All the lean and weed you smoking got you hyper than a whore Got a ratchet and a jacket, leave you lifeless in a mall Now you on Instagram, acting righteous than before Never dropped the ball, fuck, I'm like a striker when he scores Let me not see you again wearing those cheap ass suits At SoundCity, man, I almost beat that dude You weak ass goof mumble rapper, hit that booth And if you got some shit to say, you better spit that truth Motherfucker!
